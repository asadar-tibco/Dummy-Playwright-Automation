## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install Playwright browsers:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## Running Tests

### Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
# or
npx playwright test
```

### Run specific test suites:

**Smoke Tests:**
```bash
npm run test:smoke
# or
npx playwright test tests/smoke
# or
npx playwright test smoke.spec.js
```

**Build Acceptance Tests (BAT):**
```bash
npm run test:bat
# or
npx playwright test tests/bat
# or
npx playwright test bat.spec.js
```

**User Acceptance Tests (UAT):**
```bash
npm run test:uat
# or
npx playwright test tests/uat
# or
npx playwright test uat.spec.js
```

### Run tests with browser visible:
```bash
npm run test:headed
# or
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Debug tests:
```bash
npm run test:debug
# or
npx playwright test --debug
```

### Run tests for TeamCity (no browser opening):
```bash
npm run test:teamcity
```

### Generate and view Allure reports:

**Run tests and generate Allure report:**
```bash
npm run test:allure
```

**Generate Allure report only:**
```bash
npm run allure:generate
```

**Open existing Allure report:**
```bash
npm run allure:open
```

**Serve Allure report (generate and open in one command):**
```bash
npm run allure:serve
```

## Test Details

All test cases are designed for **dummy purposes only** and contain only console log messages. They are specifically created for:

- âœ… TeamCity integration testing
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline validation
- âœ… Build verification processes
- âœ… Automation framework testing

### Test Categories:

1. **Smoke Tests (5 cases)** - Basic functionality verification
2. **BAT Tests (5 cases)** - Build acceptance and critical path testing
3. **UAT Tests (5 cases)** - User acceptance and end-to-end scenarios

## TeamCity Integration (Artifact-Based)

### **âœ… Simple Setup - No Plugins Required:**

**TeamCity Build Command:**
```bash
npm run test:ci
```

**TeamCity Artifact Paths:**
```
allure-report/** => allure-report.zip
test-results/** => test-results.zip
```

### **ðŸ“Š What You Get:**
- **Immediate Results**: JUnit test results in TeamCity Tests tab
- **Rich Reports**: Download allure-report.zip and open index.html
- **Console Logs**: All test execution visible in build output
- **Screenshots/Videos**: Automatically included for failed tests

### **ðŸ“– Detailed Setup Guide:**
